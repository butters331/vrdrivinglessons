In this lesson we will learn how to navigate a traffic light. At a traffic
light you must wait at the stop line, or behind any cars that may be in
front of you. On approach to a traffic light, lane positioning is key.
If you are turning left, you must be positioned towards the left hand side
of the lane, but still inside the white line. If you are going straight
ahead or right, you must be positioned more to the right of the lane. This
is so two cars can be at the front of the junction, at one time. If you
are turning, you must check your side mirror in the direction you're 
turning on approach to the traffic light, then indicate. If you are 
turning left, you must only cut accross the left lane when there is no
oncoming traffic. Otherwise you should wait in the left of your lane, with
the nose of your car around level with the middle of the
road youre turning onto.

First a quick overview of this lesson. Firstly pull away when it is safe to 
do so, and drive normally. On approach to the traffic light, I will tell you
which direction to travel. You will then check your mirrors, indicate 
accordingly and put the car in the right position of the lane. If the 
traffic light is green, you will drive through and cross lanes safely if 
you need to do so. If the traffic light is red, you will wait behind the 
stop line, or any stationary cars, until the light turns green, then you 
will carry on.

Start the car and pull away when it is safe to do so.

Good. Turn left at the traffic light.

Now check your mirrors and indicate.

The traffic light is on green, so you may go.

Remember to check for oncoming traffic!
