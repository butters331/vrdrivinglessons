In this lesson we will learn how to manover a stop sign junction. At these
junctions, you should always come to a complete stop before moving into the
junction. You must wait at the junction until their is nothing waiting in
the lane to your right. If all lanes are occupied with waiting cars, then
the car that arrived first has right of way. Use the same road positionings
as in the traffic light lesson, and make sure to only cross lanes if its
safe to do so.

First a quick overview. Start the car and pull away when its safe to do so.
Then approaching the junction I will tell you which direction to travel.
You will then check your mirrors, indicate accordingly and put the car in 
the right position of the lane before coming to a stop at the stop sign.
When there is nothing in the lane to your right, you will pull away.

Start the car and pull away when it is safe to do so.

Good. Go straight ahead at the junction.

Good. Turn right at the junction.

Good. Turn left at the junction.

Now check your mirrors and indicate.

Great, now move the car to the left of the lane

Great, now move the car to the right of the lane

Come to a stop at the junction.

There is nothing to the right, carry on.

Wait here until the right lane is free.

Gridlock. The car here first will move.
