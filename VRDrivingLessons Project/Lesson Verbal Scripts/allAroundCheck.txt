Before pulling away in your car, you must perform an all around check to 
ensure that it is safe to do so.

To perform an all around check, you must look over your right shoulder, 
and make sure it is clear, then the right mirror, then the interior mirror,
the left mirror, and finally your shoulder. If there are no potential
hazards, then you may pull away. Make sure to move your head to show the
examinor that youre looking, not just your eyes.

Start with the right shoulder.

Now the right mirror.

Now the interior mirror.

Now the left mirror.

And now your left shoulder.

Congratulations, you have completed the first lesson.
